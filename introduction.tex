\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Rick Astley captured lighting in a bottle when he released his iconic hit
single ``Never Gonna Give You Up''~\cite{NeverGonnaGiveYouUpWiki} on July 27,
1987.
People laughed, people cried, but mostly, people accepted it as among the best
works of musical art ever written.
After its dominance as the zeitgeist of the 90s, ``Never Gonna Give You Up''
faded into relative obscurity until it was revived with a far more sinister
aim.

Today, ``Never Gonna Give You Up'' is weaponized as a deadly tool of mass
tomfoolery; amateur shitposters disguise a link to the YouTube
video~\cite{NeverGonnaGiveYouUpYouTube} in innocuous links, while it is a
mainstay of the toolkits of cyberterrorists across the globe.

Our primary contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A generally-applicable type system for rickrolls that
    provides a compile-time guarantee of the absence of rickrolls at run time.
  \item The Rickroll Checker, an open-source formal verification tool that
    implements our type system for modelling rickrolls.
\end{itemize}
