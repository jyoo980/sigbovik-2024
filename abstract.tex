A person is said to be \textit{rickrolled} when they inadvertently click on a
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ}{link} to the popular YouTube
video \textit{Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Official Music Video)}.
The seemingly innocuous activity of \textit{rickrolling} has been an attack
vector for state actors, causing trillions of dollars in damages in industries
across the world and untold psychic pain to those who click on links.

We propose a type system for modelling rickroll links that can provide a
compile-time guarantee of the absence of rickrolls in an application at run
time.
To experimentally evaluate our type system, we implemented the Rickroll
Checker, an open-source formal verification tool for Java which implements our
type system for modelling rickrolls.
